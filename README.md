## Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7 - Employee Database with SQL

### Background
Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

![Retirement Title](https://github.com/matthallman/Week_7_Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.png)
#### Employees that are soon eligible for retirement (by title).
- Senior Engineer 29,415 
- Senior Staff 28,255 
- Engineer 14,221 
- Staff 12,242 
- Technique Leader 4,502 
- Assistant Engineer 1,761 
- Managers 2

Over 90,000 employees are soon eligible for retirement including 57,700 Senior-Level staff. This number of employees all retiring at the same time would trigger a "silver tsunami". 


#### Mentorship eligiblity
- 406	Senior Staff 406
- Engineer 395
- Staff 318
- Senior Engineer 294
- Technique Leader 77
- Assistant Engineer 59

There are over 15,000 employees who were born in 1965 who while they may be eligible for retirement, they are not completely ready to retire. These employees could be used as mentors to new employees while allowing them to take the steps towards retiring. 

### Summary
Pewlett Hackard looks to have a substantial amount of employees potentially retiring in the near future. The company should leverage the senior employees to mentor newer employees looking to be promoted into new roles.  They should also create incentives for retirement age employees to commit to a solid exit date and work to stagger those end dates over the next few years to lessen the "silver tsunami" effect.
